## Transcript

Hello communities, a great to you are

back. Let's talk about agentic memory

complexities and parametric memories.

Now you know currently we have

everything in markdown file. No we have

a lot of instruction here for everything

for every skill for every soul for every

whatever markdown and then we have to

understand this. Yeah. So we do have

kind of a consolidation channel and then

some intelligence must make sense out of

this. No, bring it all together and

really understand how we integrate this

new knowledge here with the parametric

memory here of the LLM itself. And you

see this is done here by Google by

Nanobanana and this should here actually

be here an artificial neural network. So

if I did here the exact same text to

image prompt here and I put it here into

open AI here image 2.0 you see this is

more like a neural network. So you see a

comparison of Google to open. So what

are we talking about and why? April

30th, 2026, we have here the Chinese

University of Hong Kong and it's a young

university in Hungju in China. And the

authors tell us, you know what, the

contextual agentic memory of our AI

system is a memo, but it is not a true

memory. Not at all. And I love this

article because we remember years ago I

told you, imagine we have our core LLM.

No. And then we have the agentic harness

sphere where we have everything from the

rack pipeline and graph rag and database

cluster and supercomputer and lean for

and everything. And I said, now we're

building here skill markdown files and

memory markdown files and soul markdown

files and what the hell markdown files.

Why don't we bring the intelligent back

into the LLM? And now we have an

official paper and the order tell us you

know what all of these beautiful

markdown files and whatever in the order

framing this is just a lookup table but

it is definitely not a memory for an

agentic system. And I love this clear

distinction here. What is memory and

what is lookup? Where's the

intelligence?

So they argue that it creates a real

ceiling. No. And the agent can

accumulate more and more episodic

records. No, for skill one MD, skill

two, skill 15 MD file. Yet it will still

fail on novel combinations of all those

let's say 15 ideas because it never

consolidated those experience into its

internal reasoning structure into its

transformer internal tensor weights.

This was just done here with markdown

files here in the in context learning of

activations. So we're talking about two

differently uh computational levels here

of our AI systems.

And the paper says that the carnogenic

memory system are just a kind of a

diary. No you the AI learns something it

writes something down but it is not an

internalized skill that I can now

perform and the moment you switch off

this LLM no it's gone it's not

internalized at all. So this is why the

authors call this meos it's a memo but

not a true memory.

So this is the first time I see this in

this clear distinction

and then the narrative a little bit

escalates. Now so at first they argue

that there is because of this a

generalization gap. The retrieval can

recover stored cases

but it cannot reliably infer a new

composition rule for truly novel

combinations of concepts.

Second they argue that there's a frozen

novice problem. If the vit if the tens

of weights never change of our LLM,

the agent will never become more expert

across all the different session from

yesterday, today, tomorrow because

whenever you switch it off, you have to

store it in a markdown file. You just

append more textual contextual

information and yeah, it just gets here

really crowded real soon. Third, you

argue that there's a security problem.

a one-time prompt injection can become

persistent if it gets written into

long-term retrieval memory and comes

back into future sessions. So they tell

us, you know, there are two fundamental

different pathway we're going to look

at. at first changing the context C with

in context learning versus really

learning and thereby changing it to

tensor weight structure datas and most

agent memory system currently only

change the context. Huh? Prompting, rack

system, scratchpad, vector stores, pool

output, skill files. Those are

absolutely beautiful and they are

absolutely useful, but they are still

episodic and retrieval based. But what

we are interesting is if the goal is

genuine skill accumulation or rule

learning by the LLM itself by the agent

itself. The paper argues that this

experience has to be consolidated into

the tens of weight of the LLM itself not

merely stored somewhere externally in

the horn sphere of our agent.

Now this has an interesting element

because think about this we have here if

you want here that we have this

beautiful memory system configuration

only with the change of the context

because we have propriatory models no we

cannot change we cannot train a GBD 5.5

yeah it would be yeah the bank of

America maybe afford this but normal

programmer coders cannot afford to go to

GPD and say hey take your GPD 5.5 and I

want to have this fine-tuned on my

personal data now. So therefore you see

this builds up something between the

proprietary miles and the open miles and

you see why from entropic to open EI all

the global corporation really push here

for this memory systems that only change

the context here and go with markdown

files because the other thing would be

open models no where we really have a

supervised fine tuning and reinforcement

learning. So we would really consolidate

into the weights. No, but yeah, GBD 5.5

or I don't know 4.7 here is not open.

So available lesson is use the retrieval

for what the retrieval is really good at

recent data, recent facts, traces, tool

outputs, all reversible autoability.

But please do not mistake that for

learning. and the orders are really

clear in their statement and I like

this. Now if you are designing an agent

that should improve over time that

should continue to self-arning

selfreflection self-improvement

the paper now suggest that adding an

explicit consolidation channel from the

memory store from all our beautiful MD

files and memory MD and skill MD to

really do a fine tuning here with model

weights you have to bring here the

training really into the tens and the

weight structure itself.

So therefore how you do this? Well, you

can have a periodic fine-tuning, you can

go with Laura adapter, lowering

adaptations, you can go with knowledge

editing, you can go with self

distillation, you know, a small open

model, you can do rehearsal, you have

other continual learning style updates.

There are tons of different methodology

available for you. And the authors argue

now that this [clears throat]

benchmarks and I put here recall

benchmarks here mostly measure whether

the agent can retrieve old information

but not whether it has learned from it.

And I like this perspective and they

come up with a new idea. They say the

old benchmarks are not good enough for

our agents anymore. What we need is

something like a compositional

generalization over time.

So this means expose the agent to

concepts separately over many sessions

and then simply test whether it improves

a novel combination of those concepts

later. And this is a much stronger test

of learning than just a memory recall

that we have currently with our agents.

I really like this idea.

So they say we have now more or less a

formal separation between two systems.

because we have our retrieval based

memory here where you have a simple

stored d whatever it is plus a frozen m

frozen GPD 5.5 that uses here to

retrieve example in a classical

promptbased in context learning and then

on the other side we have an intrinsic

parametric learning where we have a

small I don't know QN 3.6 six no that we

have locally and that is open and we can

have really a training a post training

on this machine. So we have the same

data but consolidated now and learned

into the updated weight tensor of this

open LLM itself. So a retrieval based

memory maybe in markdown files and a

real parametric memory deep inside the

neural network of the LLM.

Now the question is if the agent sees n

examples of composition, how many does

it need to generalize well to unseen

combination of those compositions? No.

So the main theorem that the authors

come up with is a compositional sample

complexity separation. Now what does it

mean? It is rather simple. For

retrieval, any novel pair not explicitly

covered by the store in the data store

in the in context learning depends on

the frozen models in context ability,

but it is anyway bounded to be less than

perfect under any assumption.

So this means if you have now with your

in context learning and you provide I

don't know 100 or 1,000 combinations

here of explicitly covered written down

in the prompt specified text segments.

Maybe the task that you then encounter

is exactly one other methodology that is

not in the prompt and therefore it might

fail and maybe there's a little bit of

chance that our frozen model in context

ability understanding hey this is just a

small deviation from the other thing

that it can solve this

but in general you can say because

retrieval covers examples one by one in

our in context learning achieving here a

high compositional generalization

requires more or less the coverage of

essentially all relevant possible pairs

of combinations. So this means if you

have two sets that you can combine

almost indefinitely, you would have to

fill up your complete context length

just with examples here so that you can

have here a pattern recognition on your

in context learning.

The story is completely different if we

go with parametric learning.

This here is an example. Hypnics

constructs here in the paper here a

modular arithmetic task family know with

a model op. So in that family one

labeled example can identify the unknown

constant C immediately so that a

parametric system can generalize broadly

with very little data. It gets the rule

while the retrieval our MD files our

memory MD files and skill MD files still

needs to store all the many composition

explicitly because remember in context

learning is activation based and if you

go with parametric learning or post

training here this is here weightbased.

So we do have two different mathematical

operations happening here in the

tensors.

So again we have here all the 100

digital documents MD files and whatever

and achantic memory and whatever what

the hell we have here from our Rex

system and somehow through some

consolidation channel we have to encode

this now into a neural network and as I

told you either you go in context

learning with pattern recognition or you

really say I want to go post training

here with a weight update here

supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement,

learning, distillation, whatever you

enjoy. So you see this is he absolutely

fascinating how you bring all these MD

files really into a coherent

representation here of our let's say

neuronatic synapsis pattern recognition

firing system.

Yeah, for multihub reasoning there are

different ceiling bands and of course it

is better if you integrate it into the

parametric knowledge. more about this in

the paper. But I think the main new

insight is that the episodic memory,

your markdown file and the learned

memory are not interchangeable because

this retrieval here of a markdown file

can preserve and replay experience. But

it does not by itself create the

abstract rule structure within the

neural network of the eye needed here

for a true compositional generalization.

Here the mark file will simply fail.

and the authors sharpen that claim into

a theorem and they say for compositional

novel task that the LLM encounters or

the agent encounters the retrieval has a

higher sample complexity burden than the

weight-based learning and that burden

scales badly with the number of

concepts.

We already talked about the possible

alteration and multiplication when we

look at this. So you see now we are

again in a situation where we say okay

we have the EI harness but we don't let

it outside in the harness but we try to

bring it back into the intelligence if

you want here of our LLM at the center

we want that here the parametric

knowledge the width tensor update they

learn this new pattern they learn this

new rule maybe you have hundred or

thousand of examples yes but then this

is learned for example if you learn

algebra algebra then you can solve

almost any algebraic uh complexity if

you had the pre-training and continuous

uh training data set exactly for this

algebra classes.

If you go with in context learning then

you have to provide all possible

examples because then we have a pattern

recognition.

So summary a skill MD file is if you ask

me a structured sequence of instruction

it is beautiful we inject it into the

model context here is interpreted at

inference time by a fixed function here

let's say this is our whatever we have

frozen a GPD system and so the agent

behavior is simply output function that

is based on the fixed function here with

our input and of course here the mall

context here of the skill MD file

So the skill exists now as a text

conditioning in the LLM and not as an

internalized computation of the tensor

weights. Careful we are in complete

different mathematical spaces. Now a

skillmd file can encode step-by-step

procedures, decision trees, complete

heruristics or tool usage sequences how

to best use a particular tool. So it

really can simulate competence.

But this works purely because LLMs the

modern huge LLMs are really good pattern

recognition executives. No, they can

follow those instruction very well. But

scientifically if you analyze this, it

is more of a program interpretation. No,

a compiler not a skill acquisition by

the neural network.

So therefore

template the same thing. Yeah, tied to a

specific representation class. It is

casebased.

But the true learning of the eye encodes

abstract function applies this across

unseen cases, all the algebraic classes.

If we had the pre-training over all

algebraic classes and it is rulebased.

So we have an abstraction here that is

encoded in the neural network. A

template has a casebased specific

representation only.

So let's say you have 100 concepts or

100 skills or whatever you have and you

want to have combination. Oh, you want

to combine skill 11 or skills 35 and

skill 117 or whatever. You want to make

sure that your system understands

everything and every combination. So you

really cannot put 10,000 real text

combination into your context window of

your agent. Yeah. But and skill MD must

really explicitly encode many

combination or will fail an unseen one.

And this is what the author of this

paper called the coverage problem that

they encountered.

So they define more or less learning as

an information compression into the

tensor weight of the transform

architecture itself. A skill MD is fine.

It stores knowledge in a low compression

form. Let's say in a text form and it

requires a reparssing every time you do

this. So you fill up here your context

window immediately. Wait completely

different case. They store here the

knowledge in a complexity weight network

in your neural network in a highly

compressed form. It enable fast and

flexible reuse. If you switch it on it

is there. So therefore this is what they

call the experience compression spectrum

and the paper calls this here in the

particular way because they say when

learning becomes necessary you need

tensor weight updates because

novel composition will appear. So you

can then combine two skills you have

never seen before together interacting

you have hidden rules that must be

inferred suddenly. This will be uh

possible with the weight update that

learned everything. So you can discover

a pattern that is not explicitly written

in the in context learning complexity

and efficiency. If efficiency matters,

you are better off if you have a trained

LLM. But let me be absolutely clear, you

don't need this learning if your world

is absolutely fixed. There's no new

knowledge available. Everything is

innumerable and your system has learned

everything there is to learn and there's

no change. Then you don't need this tens

of weight learning because then you can

provide here all the data with in

context learning and your system has

learned all pattern complexities

already. But the very moment you want to

go beyond this, you want some novelty.

You want to have a composition maybe in

a reasoning complexity. You want to have

a robustness in your models or maybe a

scaling that you want if your complexity

level increases then all those template

or markdown files here they stop being

enough and the weight based learning

simply becomes necessary. This is here

the view of the waters of this paper and

I just want to tell you here at the end

of this video I had now some experience

because I had the idea okay if this is

the case let's have a little bit fun

with my GPD system now and I told my GPD

system as you can see here okay if this

is the case so then it would be so much

better we have small opensource AI

models no because then it can fine tune

supervised and reinforce uh meant

learning continuous I don't need a GPT

system that is proprietary closed up and

I have no access to modify it

and so here the GPD immediately comes

back after he told me yeah this paper is

beautiful this is this is the future

this is outstanding the very moment I

thought that it would make GPT more or

less yeah not necessary anymore GPT JBT

changed its argumentation a little bit

no and said hey wait a minute wait a

minute so let's clarify this no because

our large model this means the GBT

models also implicitly learned of course

the composition of course no it's key

sub is the paper limitation applies only

when a certain parameter is less than

perfect but for large GPT models no

many composition rules because the model

is so large are already learned during

the pre-training of GPT 5.5 no so

therefore this is not the case for this

model no because the skill MD model now

just activates the pattern that are

dormant that are sleeping here already

in the neural network and they have been

trained during the pre-training of GBD

5.5 and now the skill MD file is not

necessary in in context learning but

because they are dormant it now

activates those patterns No. So, GD5

tells me, hey, yeah, but with our

system, no, this is not a purely lookup

system in practice. No, just to be

clear, no. But then it tells me, no, but

when your idea does work, no. So,

there's a real regime when your

intuition is powerful. No, if you have a

narrow evolving domain, so a specialist

workflows, no, a continuous new patterns

appear. Let's say in science no you have

every day more than 1,000 new papers

about artificial intelligence orical

physics or mathematics or whatever

astrophysics no then okay this was not

well covered by the pre-training of GPT

then a small model and a continue

learning maybe no could could work

because then you cumulate specific

structure becomes highly efficient and

may hold on to your socks it may now

even outperform a large model like GBD

using only the prompts when GBD is only

in context learning because I as a

simple user cannot afford to have a

supervised fine tune reinforcement

learning of GBD 5.5 if I would be the

bank of America it would be a different

topic but for the moment no way

but it also told me but I mean the real

winning setup is of course the big mall

the big GBT no plus I pay for the

learning plus the memory structure

And I'm not really with my idea now that

I see this as a small model versus a big

model. Now, so an open-source model

versus GPD 5.5. Now, this is here my

incorrect

um idea. Now, it is the winning setup

big plus learning plus memory and your

pay till the end.

But it also said, okay, if you want to

refine your claim here into something

scientifically correct, then I love this

influencing

formulation here by GBT. No, because I

said, hey, a smaller model is therefore

better. So into something scientifically

correct, a smaller model with continual

weight updates can outperform larger

models. Wow. Wow. Wow. that relies only

on contextbased memory in context

learning on task requiring accumulation

of new domain specific compositional

knowledge not present in the LLM large

models pre-training and you know a lot

of these huge system have here a

knockoff date here about I don't know

January 2025 or mid 2025 so almost a

year or more than a year now so

everything that happened in this year is

not in the pre-training of let's say a

GPD system so it has to rely here on in

context learning to provide additional

new updated information

but this is simple if it is a simple

fact no a date or $512

but it is a complex learning algorithm a

complex procedure that is in

contradiction with its parametric

knowledge the thing will become much

more interesting yeah But anyway, so

chippity tells me okay in there is a

little tiny idea if you go into this

specific domain let's say AI or research

or science then a smaller open-source

model can here outperform a larger

model. Thank you so much. No it gives me

an example here. So the internal company

process might be for a large LLM like

GPT relies here on a skill MD file

struggles here with edge cases and of

course there's no improvement of the

real GPT 5.5 over time because I can't

modify the weights here it's proprietary

model by OpenI but if I have a small

open-source model locally here on my

desktop I can do some finetuning on real

interaction on real time interaction I

can have that the LLM now internalizes

the pattern in the neural network

itself. I'm not any more contextual

textualbased limited and this becomes

much more consistent and much more

faster because it is now integrated in

the neural network structure and here

chipped tells me here your idea is

absolutely valid.

So I'm loving it but just for you to

take away if you want a oneliner

supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement

learning. Yes, of course, we need for

the training data for those models

thousands of examples huge I don't know

10,000 pages or whatever then we have

our weight updates but then it has also

here the generalization while within

context learning with ICL now here with

our markdown files that we put into the

prompt of an LMB we also have provide

many examples and the more if we have

combinatorial problems we have to really

print out each and every possible

combinatorial element here, put it in

the prompt to have a better behavior.

And if we are absolutely unlucky, then

our task is exactly this 1,01

prompt combination that we did not put

in the prompt and then the model fails

to perform this because it is a pattern

recognition system and it has not a

generalization of a weight update. So

scientifically I think it's fair to say

those two different models here those

two different methodologies are not

equivalent systems. The different is not

just the scale but it is how the

information the data the knowledge is

internally represented in the layer of

the transformer and how it is used and

how it is computed. ICL is about

activations and if you want tens of

weight update is here really about

weight modification back propagation you

know the whole story

so therefore no jet

so it is not always true that a small

trained model is better than a large

model now no way now you have to pay for

GPT but the correct synthesis how I

should see this is the scale of a GPD

5.5 this beautiful model it provides the

initial capability

And then okay the learning enables yeah

capability growth but yeah we have to

start with a GPD system and a oneliner

answer is also a small model that learns

can surpass a large one that doesn't but

only within the domain it has actually

learned and not in general. So GPT is

the best thing for all 8 billion people

on this planet.

You can have sometimes a little bit of

fun with talking or discussing these

topics here with your preferred EI

system. I hope you had a little bit of

fun, some new information, some new

insights. Maybe you want to try out

something yourself with your preferred

AI system. Anyway, it would be great to

see you in my next video.
